  *The Economistsâ€™ Voice*, Forthcoming.

  Much of the discussion on income mobility is focused on mitigating inequality through
taxation and redistribution without considering the institutional and regulatory landscape that
contributes to a decrease in income mobility. We present evidence on the role of economic
freedom and deregulation in increasing income mobility and argue that policies promoting the
two offer a more potent solution towards improving the economic status of the poor. Economic
freedom can mitigate the impact of technological shocks on individuals in the lower end of the
income distribution, an issue that has significant policy implications in light of the changing
technological landscape.

  Abstract: Technological change has long been tied with distributional concerns due to displacement against certain skills on labor markets. Short-run dislocations could create scarring in the long-run. For example, shifts against less skilled workers with children could limit their ability to improve the inter-generational income mobility of their children. However, the existing literature rarely emphasizes the possibility that the ill-effects of technological change are conditional on government regulations that limit the ability of workers to rapidly adjust thus creating the scarring. In this article, we document the importance of these regulations by focusing on changes in occupational licensing of low-income professions, exposure to industrial automation in the United States since the 1980s and inter-generational income mobility. We find that a significant share of the prediction of falling income mobility tied to automation are actually tied to changes in occupational licensing. Areas that experienced labor market deregulation and high exposure to automation suffered far less than areas that did not engage in deregulation.

- **Impact of Broadband Access on Economic Development: A Synthetic Control Approach** (With Thomas Stratmann)

We analyze the impact of broadband internet access on economic outcomes using the case of a tribal led initiative to bring high-speed broadband internet to the Colville Reservation in 2013. Employing a synthetic control approach, we find robust and significant effects with increases in Native American per capita income and higher labor force participation. These findings are particularly noteworthy given the broader challenges in assessing the  global impact of broadband in developing countries -- challenges that stem largely from data limitations and heterogeneity in digital infrastructure. Native American reservations, which face socioeconomic conditions akin to those in many developing regions, serve as a compelling case study. Our results underscore the potential of digital connectivity to foster economic development.
